appointments-app
================

This is a demo app only. It's for Medfusion's "Simple Appointments Dashboard" challenge.


Setup and Launch
---------

1. `npm install`
2. `node server/server.js`


Notes
-----

This uses CanJS at present; if time permits I plan to create one version using plain jQuery, and one using Angular.
